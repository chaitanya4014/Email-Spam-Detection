# Email-Spam-Detection-Using-Hybrid-Ensemble-Feature-Selection-Technique

An effective model is built using ensemble feature selection techniques such as Homogeneous, Heterogeneous and Hybrid approach. Using these approaches we have selected most relevant features and performed classification against various algorithms. The various classification algorithms used are Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble Bagging and Boosting. Feature selection methods used in this work are Joint Mutual Information, Minimum-Relevance and Maximum-Redundancy, Interaction Capping, Conditional Mutual Information Maximization and Double Input Symmetrical Relevance. The proposed system is intensively evaluated through a series of extensive experiments based on three Email corpora. The experimental results confirm that the proposed system can achieve remarkable results in terms of accuracy, precision, and” recall. Using Hybrid Approach we have found that accuracy of the classifier was increased to 89.6% for CSDMC2010 dataset and 96.2% for LingSpam dataset and 93.9% for SpamAssasin dataset.
